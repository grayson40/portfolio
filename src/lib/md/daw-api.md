The `DAW API` is the central nervous system for your Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) environment, powered by Go and MySQL. This API is dedicated to providing a robust back-end service that interfaces between your DAW CLI and the remote repository website, akin to platforms like GitHub, but tailored for audio production workflows.
